locker: A handy command wrapper

For when you don't want to have to write your own lockfile and log handling.

Usage:

    locker [options] --execute [command] --name [name]

OPTIONS:

  --execute [command]

    The command to execute

  --name [name]

    A 'name' for this command (probably a cronjob). This is the name of the file
    create in --lockdir (see below, default: /tmp).

    If this begins with a '.' or a '/' then that path is used, and --lockdir is
    ignored.

  --help 

    See this (long) help

  --h
  
    Shorter help output

  OUTPUT:

    By default, all output is printed to stderr and stdout. Lines of locker's 
    own output is prefixed with one of 'INFO', 'ERROR' or 'DEBUG', and lines the
    given command printed to standard out with 'STDOUT, and to standard error 
    with 'STDERR'

    --log [path]

    will cause this all to be written to the new file at [path] instead. 

    --stdout [path], --stderr [path]

    will do same for the stdout and stderr of the executed command, creating new
    files.

    --append-log, --append-stdout, --append-stderr

    will cause these files to be appended-to rather than overwritten. Note that
    the command is executed, then its stdout is printed, and then its stderr.

    Alternatively, the stderr/stdout of commands can be dumped with one or both
    of:

    --no-stderr, --no-stdout

    These switches affect both the 'main' command (passed to -e/--execute) and 
    any run as --on-success or --on-failure.


  LOCKING:
  
    --lockdir [path] 

    Specifies a path under which to create the file given with --name. When 
    --name begins with a '.' or a '/', --lockdir is ignored.


  COMMAND EXECUTION

    The command given to '--execute' is exeucted and locker exits with the same
    status as this command.
    
    Post-run commands can be executed with:

    --after-success [command]
    --after-failure [command]

    The output of these is treated exactly as if it were the output of the 
    main command, with regards to output (re)direction. The exit status of
    these is logged but doesn't affect the exiting of locker.

 EXAMPLES:

   locker -n websitecron -e 'php5 ~/public_html/cron.php' -f ./bin/cron-failure.sh --log ./logs/website-cron.log

   locker -n dbdump -e ~/bin/dbdump.sh -s ~/bin/db_success.sh -f ~/bin/db_failure.sh --no-stderr --no-stdout >/dev/null
